# applied-statistics

## Content
This repository contains the tasks and the project for the subject of the same name for the Higher diploma in data analytics at ATU Galway

The tasks involve 4 tests that deal with different elements applicable to statistics:

1) Task 1: Permutations and Combinations

2) Task 2: numpy's Normal Distribution

3) Task 3: t-Test Calculation

4) Task 4: ANOVA

The project consists on analyze the PlantGrowth R dataset.
It will contain a series of guidelines and instructions and will cover all the techniques and technologies learned during the module.  

Both the project and the tasks are in Jupyter notebook format.

## Installation

The following instructions are to clone and run any code or notebook contained in this repository.  

### **Cloning the Repository**:  

1. Install Git: Install Git on your system. You can download it from here:  
   https://git-scm.com/downloads  

   If you already have Git installed, you can get the latest development version via Git itself:

   `git clone https://github.com/git/git`

   You can also always browse the current contents of the Git repository using the web interface.

2. Open Terminal/Command Prompt: Open the terminal or command prompt on your system.

3. Navigate to the Directory: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository:  

   `cd <path/to/destination/folder>`

4. Clone the Repository: Use the `git clone` command followed by the repository URL to clone it:  

   `git clone repository_url.git`
   
   Replace `repository_url.git` with the actual URL of the repository you want to clone.  

   Example: `https://github.com/jalaca91/applied-statistics.git`  

   This is the URL for this repository.

### **Running Code/Notebooks**:  

**For Code**:  
1. Choose the IDE/Editor: Depending on the programming language, select an appropriate IDE or text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, etc.).  
2. Open the Project: Open the cloned repository in your chosen IDE/Editor.  

**For Notebooks**:  
1. Install Jupyter Notebook/Lab: If not installed, install Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. You can do this via pip:  

   `pip install jupyterlab`  

   If you have installed Anaconda, it is already included in the system by default.  

2. Navigate to the Notebook: In your terminal, navigate to the directory where the notebook is located.  

3. Start Jupyter: Type `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` in the terminal and press Enter. This will open the Jupyter interface in your default web browser.  

4. Access the Notebook: Use the browser interface to locate and open the notebook file with the `.ipynb` extension.  

5. Run Cells: Inside the notebook, execute the code cells one by one or use the "Run All" option to run the entire notebook, which shows the input and output of all the code and Markdown boxes that make up the notebook.
